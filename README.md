## Introduction

Hi, :wave: I'm Joey and welcome to my GitHub repo for my Meeting Web App project!


I'm a Software Engineer and, once upon a time the small group I work with grew in size. 
When it did, we need a fair way of picking the order in which developers spoke in our Scrum meetings. 
To quickly fix the problem at hand I remember writing a ~10 line console app that did the job. 
However, now that we've used it for so long others need access - and more so - the delivery and management of updates to the list should be standardized. 
So this project is to serve that purpose.


This project is a simple web site that displays a randomized order foreach member on the team. 
It randomizes the order based on the current day as the seed, so every day it automatically creates a new order if the site is accessed. 
I'm going to be hosting this web site on Heroku (because it's free) and will be setting up automatic CI/CD deploys to their cloud everytime I push to master. 
I would like to attempt to setup an RSS feed so that our Microsoft Teams chat can display this info in a chat message when we begin our meeting.
